<h2>FAQ</h2><strong>What fuels do your lanterns use?</strong>
<br>Most of our lanterns can be equipped for Natural gas or propane. (Exceptions are noted on the products. All Charleston Lighting lanterns can be equipped for electric lighting.)
<br>
<br><strong>How long will it take to build a custom lantern?</strong>
<br>Lead time for a custom lantern is approximately 6-8 weeks. This time frame may vary, please call for specific information.
<br>
<br><strong>How will my lantern be mounted?</strong>
<br>All of our lanterns can be wall mounted, most can also be mounted on a standard (pole) or hanging by a yoke or a chain.
<br>
<br><strong>Why must my gas lantern be hung on a yoke or stem?</strong>
<br>Hanging a gas lantern within a yoke or on a stem keeps the lantern from swinging freely, which can weaken the gas line and possibly cause a rupture.  Historically the arms were used to lean the ladder against while refilling the fuel and lighting the lantern.
<br>
<br><strong>Are your lanterns certified by CSA?</strong>
<br>Yes, all of Charleston Lighting’s gas lanterns are CSA approved & certified. Our production facility is audited quarterly by a CSA representative for quality control. 
<br>
<br><strong>What is the required pressure in a gas line for a gas lantern?</strong>
<br>We recommend that you use 10-12 inches of water column pressure (10 xxxx). If you are having problems with your lantern staying lit and you pressure is 8 inches of water column pressure or less this may be the problem.
<br>
<br><strong>What size gas line fittings are needed for installation of a gas lantern?</strong>
<br>You need a standard ¼” copper gas line with flared fitting.
<br>
<br><strong>How are your Standards (the pole) installed?</strong>
<br>Our standards are cast to be secured at the base by anchor bolts when installed on cement.  The Standard can be a direct burial (24”) for installation that is not on cement.
<br>
<br><strong>What gauge of copper do you use to manufacture lanterns?</strong>
<br>We use 24oz copper for most lanterns.  We also use sheet  thicknesses that vary from 16oz to 32oz for various parts and accessories.
<br>
<br><strong>How does an electric igniter work?</strong>
<br>Electric igniters work off a standard 120 v current.  A 24volt transformer MUST be used to reduce the current. Our igniters are equipped with a photo cell (dusk to dawn switch) that allows for the automatic lighting and shut off of the burner during nighttime hours. You may also install a light switch to allow for early cut off.
